# friendsfirst

University can be isolating, especially for new or international students who struggle to find study partners or make meaningful connections. Traditional networking happens randomly or through large, impersonal group chats, making it difficult to find the right people to collaborate with.

Solution – UniConnect (working name)
UniConnect is a friendship-first matching app designed specifically for university students to find study buddies and social connections based on their courses, interests, and study habits. Think Hinge meets LinkedIn – but for campus friendships and academic support.

Key Features:

Smart Matching: Connects students based on shared courses, study preferences (silent vs. collaborative), and extracurricular interests.
Icebreaker Prompts: Encourages meaningful conversations beyond “What unit are you in?”
Study Session Planning: Built-in scheduling to set up study sessions at UNSW libraries, cafés, or even online.
Verified Campus Network: Only for students with a UNSW email, keeping the community safe and relevant.
Why It Matters:

Enhances academic collaboration (better grades through effective study groups).
Tackles student loneliness and mental well-being by fostering real connections.
Scalable – can expand to other universities and integrate with student societies or university events.
The Ask:
We’re looking for mentorship and support to refine our MVP, validate demand, and explore potential partnerships with UNSW student services or societies. Would love your insights on making this a reality! 🚀
